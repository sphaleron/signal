This repository will contain assorted signal processing code in C & Octave,
mostly inspired by my reading of Mallat's "Wavelet Tour of Signal Processing".
Right now there is not much useful for anyone else, but I hope to get a bit more
involved with sparse representations and redundant dictionaries.

The applications I have in mind are related to audio processing (guitar fx:),
2D/3D image processing and linear inverse problems.
